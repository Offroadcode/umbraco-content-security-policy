    This config creates Content-Security-Policy headers to help secure your site. Each Policy can contain a location,
    list of sources, and allowed calls inside those sources.

    <Policy location="http://mydomain.com">

    If your policy has a location, such as a domain, then it will only add that security policy as a header to that domain.
    If your policy does not have a location, it will load this policy for every domain in this Umbraco instance.
    Alternately, your policy can have a location, such as a virtual folder, which contains a part of your app that runs separatelyL

    <Policy location="/umbraco/">

    This will only load the policy for the back office of Umbraco, which has different content with different URLs loaded into it

    Beneath that, you can have a source, and a set of allowed items. These sources can run the full range of everything the header allows,
    but are supported differently for different browsers. To see a list sources and their browser support, go to:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP
	
	NOTE: The order of your policies matters! If you have a folder policy above a domain policy, the domain policy will override the folder policy.
	Make sure you put them in the proper order!
